# Poker
## Development
1. In the app's root directory, run `npm install`
2. Add a file called `.env` in the root directory, and add necessary environment variables
	- Take a look at the `example.env` for reference

3. To start the server, run `npm run watch-server`
4. To start the client, run `npm run watch-client`
5. To view the client, visit localhost in your browser on the specified port given to the PORT environment variable added to the `.env` you created (see step 2)
